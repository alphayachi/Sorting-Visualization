# Sorting-Visualization
This project helps visualize different sorting algorithms.
HTML and CSS along with Bootstrap have been used for styling.
50 bars are created through JavaScript and are of random heights ranging 5px to 400px.
These bars rearrange according to the sorting algorithm in an ascending order. The sorting algorithm is implemented in javascript.
Vanilla JavaScript has been used so no need to learn any external JS library.
Sorting Algorithms which can be visualized using this web app are - 
Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
